Integer:

COLORMAP needs to allow for two reg overlaps on 32bit
Debug shifts that are not by 1 - regalloc is looping
Test the various intstruction compares and helpers

Why does excluding -xtemps generate us bogus XXX in the sconvs ?

Long:

Table filled in not much else started

Float:

Not touched


Problems:

We are very tight on registers and spills don't work for anything containing
Y. Thus we allow for Y spills using longer sequences that stack a and go via
a. Without this the compiler register allocator appears to get backed into
a corner and doesn't know how to escape.
