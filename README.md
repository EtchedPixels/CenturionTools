# Centurion Tools

An assembler, linker and related tools for the Warrex Centurion CPU-6.

## Basic usage

````
as [-l listfile] [-o objfile] foo.s

ld -b -C addr foo.o -o foo
````

The Warrex elements of the tool chain are new and lightly tested. The core of
the tool chain is well established and used for many other targets including
the TMS9995 and 6800 C compiler kits.

## Status

This is an initial cut at an assembler for what we know of the Warrex
Centurion CPU6 processor. The syntax is primarily taken from the EE200 but
in addition more generic operations like XFR A,B are permitted instead of
just the official XAB.

As with the EE200 the source is on the left, so XFRB AL,BL places AL into
BL, and SUB A,B subtracts A from B (and has the short form SAB).

It should pick the shortest forms for instructions when it can.

Address mode syntax

````
	nn		constant
	(nn)		address
	@(nn)		address, indirected
	(X)		register dereference
	-5(X)		register dereference with offset
	A,(-X)		register pre-decremeent
	(X+)		register post-increment
	12(-S)		register pre-decrement with offset
	4(S+)		register post-increment with offset

	JMP (PC + 6)	jump to PC + 6
	JMP @(PC + 6)	jump to (PC + 6)
````

Note that jump is a bit incoherent because JUMP actually uses the address
generator and stores the generated address into PC. We map

	JMP xxxx
	JMP (xxxx)

to one or two levels of indirection appropriately but don't currently do so
for (PC + 6) which is literally 'on 6 places' so ought to be JUMP PC + 6.
This needs some kind of sanity applying once we have an actual instruction
set.

Instructions referencing memory locations are sized by the instruction form.

## Supported Instructions
