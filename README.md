# Centurion Tools

An assembler, linker and related tools for the Warrex Centurion CPU-6.

## Basic usage

````
as [-l listfile] [-o objfile] foo.s

ld -b -C addr foo.o -o foo
````

The Warrex elements of the tool chain are new and lightly tested. The core of
the tool chain is well established and used for many other targets including
the TMS9995 and 6800 C compiler kits.

## Status

This is an initial cut at an assembler for what we know of the Warrex
Centurion CPU6 processor. The register naming is believed to be right
except for the mystery top registers. Things like instruction naming and
syntax are another question.

It should pick the shortest forms for instructions when it can.

Address mode syntax

````
	LD A,nn			constant
	LD A,(nn)		address
	LD A,@(nn)		address, indirected
	LD A,(X)		register dereference
	LD A,-5(X)		register dereference with offset
	LD A,(-X)		register pre-decremeent
	LD A,(X+)		register post-increment
	LD A,12(-S)		register pre-decrement with offset
	LD A,4(S+)		register post-increment with offset
	LD A,(PC + 6)		jump to PC + 6
	LD A,@(PC + 6)		jump to (PC + 6)
````

The syntax is a bit ad-hoc and based upon the reverse engineering work. It
will change if documentation gives us more useful results. Note that jump
in particular is a bit incoherent because JUMP actually uses the address
generator and stores the generated address into PC. We map

	JUMP xxxx
	JMP (xxxx)

to one or two levels of indirection appropriately but don't currently do so
for (PC + 6) which is literally 'on 6 places' so ought to be JUMP PC + 6.
This needs some kind of sanity applying once we have an actual instruction
set.

Not yet handled
* MMU ops
* All of the cases we want self extending and backwards jumps
* BRA label  (aka JUMP PC+n but self extending)

Instruction size is determined by the register references. There are no
memory to memory instructions so the size is always explicit.
